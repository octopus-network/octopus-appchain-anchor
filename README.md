## Function specification

Generally speaking, this contract has the following responsibilities:

* Manage the settings data related to corresponding appchain, this contract itself and the predefined protocol of Octopus Network.
* Manage the lifecycle of corresponding appchain.
* Manage the cross-chain assets for corresponding appchain. Including the NEAR fungible token(s) and wrapped appchain token.
* Handle the staking actions happened in NEAR protocol.
* Manage the validator set for corresponding appchain.
* Manage the rewards of validators and delegators of corresponding appchain.

This contract provides a set of view functions for querying the status of the contract and necessary history data related to the above business.

### Manage appchain settings

This contract has a set of functions to manage the value of each field of `appchain settings`.

### Manage anchor settings

This contract has a set of functions to manage the value of each field of `anchor settings`.

### Manage protocol settings

This contract has a set of functions to manage the value of each field of `protocol settings`.

### Manage NEAR fungible token

This contract can bridge multiple NEAR fungible tokens to the corresponding appchain. The limitation is: the total market value of all `NEAR fungible token` bridged to the corresponding appchain, cannot exceed the market value of a certain percent of all OCT token staked in this contract. The percentage is managed by `maximum_market_value_percent_of_near_fungible_tokens` of `protocol settings`.

This contract should provide the following public interfaces related to NEAR fungible token management:

* Regster NEAR fungible token.
* Set price of a NEAR fungible token. This action can only be performed by `token_price_maintainer_account` which is managed in `anchor settings`.
* Open bridging for a NEAR fungible token.
* Close bridging for a NEAR fungible token.

When this contract receives a deposit of a certain amount of a registered `NEAR fungible token`, this contract should check the limitation and then generate `appchain notification` for corresponding appchain to mint equivalent amount of the `NEAR fungible token`.

![Transfer NEAR fungible token to appchain](/images/sq1-1.png)

When this contract receives an `appchain message` which indicates that the appchain has burnt a certain amount of a registered `NEAR fungible token`, this contract should unlock equivalent amount of the NEAR fungible token and transfer them to the proper account in NEAR protocol.

![Transfer NEAR fungible token back to NEAR protocol](/images/sq1-2.png)

### Manage wrapped appchain token

The contract of `wrapped appchain token` in NEAR protocol should be deployed before the appchain go `active`. The owner of the token contract should be set to the owner of this contract. The initial total supply of `wrapped appchain token` should be minted to an account belongs to the appchain team.

The limitation of `wrapped appchain token` is: the market value of `wrapped appchain token` in NEAR contract cannot exceed the market value of a certain percent of all OCT token staked in this contract. The percentage is managed by `maximum_market_value_percent_of_wrapped_appchain_token` of `protocol settings`.

This contract should provide the following public interfaces related to wrapped appchain token management:

* Set metadata of wrapped appchain token.
* Set contract account of wrapped appchain token.
* Set initial balance of wrapped appchain token.
* Set price of wrapped appchain token. This action can only be performed by `token_price_maintainer_account` which is managed in `anchor settings`.
* Burn wrapped appchain token. Which will generate `appchain notification` for corresponding appchain to mint equivalent amount of native token.

![Transfer wrapped appchain token back to appchain](/images/sq2-1.png)

When this contract receives an `appchain message` which indicates that the appchain has locked a certain amount of `wrapped appchain token`, this contract should mint equivalent amount of `wrapped appchain token` in the corresponding NEAR fungible token contract.

### Manage staking

#### Register validator

Any user in NEAR protocol can deposit a certain amount (not less than `minimum_validator_deposit` of `protocol settings`) of OCT token to this contract to register his/her account as a `validator` of next `era` of corresponding appchain. The user should also specify the validator account id which will be used in the corresponding appchain, and specify the flag which indicates that 'whether the validator wants to be delegated to'.

#### Increase stake of validator

Any user in NEAR protocol can deposit a certain amount of OCT token to this contract to increase his/her stake as a `validator` in next `era` of corresponding appchain. The user must be already a registered `validator` and the `validator` must not be unbonded.

#### Register delegator

Any user in NEAR protocol can deposit a certain amount (not less than `minimum_delegator_deposit` of `protocol settings`) of OCT token to this contract to register his/her account as a `delegator` of next `era` of corresponding appchain. The user should also specify the validator account id (in the corresponding appchain) that he/she want to delegate to.

#### Increase delegation of delegator

Any user in NEAR protocol can deposit a certain amount of OCT token to this contract to increase his/her delegation as a `delegator` in next `era` of corresponding appchain. The user must be already a registered `delegator` of a certain `validator` and the `delegator` must not be unbonded.

#### Unbond validator

A registered `validator` can unbond himself/herself from corresponding appchain. The contract will mark this `validator` as `unbonding`, and apply this action while generating validator set for the next era.

#### Unbond delegator

A registered `delegator` can unbond himself/herself from a specific `validator` of corresponding appchain. At this case, this contract should remove the `delegator` from the `validator set` of next `era` of corresponding appchain. The lock period of the unbonded delegation will start from the start time of next `era` and last for the duration of `unlock_period_of_delegator_deposit` of `protocol settings`, before the delegator can withdraw the unbonded delegation.

#### Decrease stake of validator

A validator can decrease his/her stake while the validator is still active (not unbonded) in corresponding appchain. The deposit of the validator after the reduction cannot be less than `minimum_validator_deposit` of `protocol settings`, and the total stake of the `validator set` of next `era` after the reduction cannot be less than 2/3 of the total stake of the `validator set` of last `era`. The lock period of the decreased stake will start from the start time of next `era` and last for the duration of `unlock_period_of_validator_deposit` of `protocol settings`, before the validator can withdraw the decreased stake.

#### Decrease delegation of delegator

A delegator can decrease his/her delegation while the delegator is still active (not unbonded) in corresponding appchain. The deposit of the delegator after the reduction cannot be less than `minimum_delegator_deposit` of `protocol settings`, and the total stake of the `validator set` of next `era` after the reduction cannot be less than 2/3 of the total stake of the `validator set` of last `era`. The lock period of the decreased delegation will start from the start time of next `era` and last for the duration of `unlock_period_of_delegator_deposit` of `protocol settings`, before the delegator can withdraw the decreased delegation.

#### Staking history

Each of the above actions will generate a corresponding `staking history` that is stored in this contract. These staking histories are used to restore the `validator set` of a certain `era`.

#### Enable/disable delegation

A validator can also change the flag which is set at registering time and stored in this contract, the flag indicates that 'whether he/she wants to be delegated to'. After this flag is set to `false`, delegators cannot delegate to this validator any more. But those delegators already delegated to this validator will be kept.

#### Permissions

The staking actions also depend on the state of corresponding appchain:

Staking action | AppchainState: Staging | AppchainState: Booting | AppchainState: Active | AppchainState: Frozen | AppchainState: Broken
---|---|---|---|---|---
register_validator | allowed |  | allowed |  |
increase_stake | allowed |  | allowed |  |
register_delegator | allowed |  | allowed |  |
increase_delegation | allowed |  | allowed |  |
decrease_stake |  |  | allowed |  |
decrease_delegation |  |  | allowed |  |
unbond_stake |  |  | allowed |  | allowed
unbond_delegation |  |  | allowed |  | allowed

### Manage beefy light client

This contract manages a stateful beefy light client for the verification of `appchain message`. The state of the light client is periodically synced by `octopus relayer` (the state data relayed must be verified first, of course). All `appchain message` s relayed by `octopus relayer` must be verified by the light client before they are applied in this contract.

> Refer to the implementation of [octopus beefy light client](https://github.com/octopus-network/beefy-light-client).

### Process appchain messages

This contract can verify (by using beefy light client) and stage `appchain message` s relayed by `octopus relayer`. As the gas consumption of a `appchain message` may exceed the gas limitation in NEAR protocol, the processing of staged `appchain message` s may cost multiple transactions to finish. This contract has a permissionless function to process staged `appchain message` s. This function will be called repeatedly by `octopus relayer` until all staged messages are applied in this contract.

The `appchain message` s which can be applied in this contract have the following types:

* Fungible token burnt in appchain - refer to [Manage NEAR fungible token](#manage-near-fungible-token)
* Appchain native token locked in appchain - refer to [Manage wrapped appchain token](#manage-wrapped-appchain-token)
* New era is planed in appchain - refer to [Switch validator set](#switch-validator-set)
* Reward of era can be distributed - refer to [Distribute reward of era](#distribute-reward-of-era)

### Switch validator set

When this contract receives an `appchain message` which indicates that the corresponding appchain has switched to a new `era`, this contract should:

* Create a new (empty) `validator set` for the given `era`.
* Copy the whole state of the `validator set` of the previous `era` of the given `era`.
* Unbond the validators who are marked as `unbonding`:
  * Remove all delegators of the `validator` from the `validator set`. The lock period of the decreased delegation will start from the start time of next `era` and last for the duration of `unlock_period_of_delegator_deposit` of `protocol settings`, before the delegator can withdraw the unbonded delegation.
  * Remove the `validator` from the `validator set`. The lock period of the unbonded stake will start from the start time of next `era` and last for the duration of `unlock_period_of_validator_deposit` of `protocol settings`, before the validator can withdraw the unbonded stake.
* Unbond the validators who are marked as `auto_unbonding` (refer to [Distribute reward of era](#distribute-reward-of-era)):
  * Remove all delegators of the `validator` from the `validator set`. The lock period of the decreased delegation will start from the start time of next `era` and last for the duration of `unlock_period_of_delegator_deposit` of `protocol settings`, before the delegator can withdraw the unbonded delegation.
  * Remove the `validator` from the `validator set`. The lock period of the unbonded stake will start from the start time of next `era` and last for the duration of `unlock_period_of_validator_deposit` of `protocol settings`, before the validator can withdraw the unbonded stake.
* Restore the state of the `validator set` by sequentially applying all staking histories happened by the time of this `appchain message` is received (that is the staking histories happened from the last `era` was switched).

During this process:

* Generate a copy of the status of all `validator`(s) in the `validator set` of the given `era`. It is for the query of appchain nodes. (Because the data struct for query of appchain nodes may be defferent with the internal storage of this contract.)
* Generate the history of `unbonded stake` if `stake decreased`, `delegation decreased`, `validator unbonded` or `delegator unbonded` happened in last era of the given era. The rule is described in [Manage staking](#manage-staking).

> The validator and delegator need to withdraw the unbonded stakes manually.

Notice that, due to the gas limit of a transaction, the whole process may cost more than one transaction to complete.

![Switch validator set](/images/sq3.png)

### Distribute reward of era

When this contract receives an `appchain message` which indicates that the corresponding appchain has finished an `era` and needs to distribute the reward of the `era`, this contract should:

* Store the `unprofitable validator id list` carried by the `appchain message` in the `validator set` of the given `era`.
* Mint a certain amount of `wrapped appchain token` in the corresponding token contract. The amount is `era_reward` of `appchain settings`.
* Distribute the `era_reward` proportionally to all profitable validators and delegators, and store the results in this contract.
* Mark validators who should be `auto_unbond`:
  * If a validator did not receive reward in a certain amount of consecutive `era`s, it will be marked as `auto_unbonding`. The count of consecutive `era`s is `maximum_allowed_unprofitable_era_count` of `protocol_settings`.

> The validator and delegator need to withdraw the rewards manually.

Notice that, due to the gas limit of a transaction, the whole process may cost more than one transaction to complete.

![Distribute reward of era](/images/sq4.png)

### Withdraw reward

A validator or deleagtor can withdraw their reward in latest eras at any time. The earliest era in which they can withdraw is limited by `maximum_era_count_of_unwithdrawn_benefit` of `protocol settings`.

### Withdraw unbonded stake

A validator or delegator can withdraw the unbonded stake which is belonged them. Each unbond action will be recorded in this contract, and the unlock period of these unbonded stakes is calculated separatly (as described in [Manage staking](#manage-staking)).

### Manage appchain lifecycle

The owner of appchain anchor can manually change the state of corresponding appchain. These actions need to check necessary conditions before changing the state of corresponding appchain. And after changing the state, this contract will call function `sync_state_of` of `appchain registry` contract to synchronize the state to `appchain registry`. (The `appchain registry` will ensure the caller account of this function is `<appchain_id>.<appchain registry account>`.)

### Pause or resume asset transfer

The owner account of this contract can pause or resume asset transfer in this contract. The actions that will be limited should be:

* Transfer OCT token into this contract by function `ft_transfer_call` of OCT token contract, with a certain message attached (to register a validator).
* Transfer registered NEAR fungible token into this contract by function `ft_transfer_call` of the registered NEAR fungible token contract, with a certain message attached (to transfer to a certain account in appchain).
* Burn wrapped appchain token (to transfer back to a certain account in appchain).
* Mint wrapped appchain token (by a verified cross-chain message to transfer native appchain token to a certain account in NEAR protocol).
* Withdraw unbonded stake (of a validator or a delegator) with OCT token.
* Withdraw rewards of a validator with wrapped appchain token.
* Withdraw rewards of a delegator with wrapped appchain token.

### Pause or resume rewards withdrawal

The owner account of this contract can pause or resume rewards withdrawal in this contract. The actions that will be limited should be:

* Withdraw rewards of a validator with wrapped appchain token.
* Withdraw rewards of a delegator with wrapped appchain token.

## Initial deployment

We should take the following steps to initialize this contract and all related contract:

* Prepare the OCT token contract. (Deploy a new one in testnet or use the one created by Aurora Rainbow Bridge in mainnet.)
* Prepare the appchain registry contract. Refer to [Octopus Appchain Registry](https://github.com/octopus-network/octopus-appchain-registry).
* Conclude an appchain in Appchain Registry. After this, the anchor account, that is the account for this contract will be created automatically. The first full access key of anchor account will also be created in this action, with the public key of the owner account of Appchain Registry contract.
* To deploy the contract code to anchor account by [near-cli](https://github.com/near/near-cli), we need to do the following actions:
  * Copy the key pair file of the owner of Appchain Registry contract, which is used to call the function `new` to initialize the Appchain Registry contract. (The public key of owner can be queried by view funcion `get_owner_pk` of Appchain Registry contract.) The key pair file can be found in folder `~/.near-credentials/testnet`.
  * Change name of the key pair file copy to `<appchain id>.<contract account of appchain registry>.json`, and change the value of `account_id` inside the json file to `<appchain id>.<contract account of appchain registry>`.
* Deploy this contract on account `<appchain id>.<contract account of appchain registry>` with parameters `appchain id`, `contract account of OCT token` and `contract account of appchain registry` by `near-cli`.
* Determine the account id of wrapped appchain token contract, and store it in this contract. (By calling function `set_account_of_wrapped_appchain_token`.)
* Determine the `premined beneficiary` and `premined balance`. (Normally decided by the appchain team.)
* Deploy the wrapped appchain token contract with parameters `premined beneficiary`, `premined balance`, `contract account of appchain anchor (this contract)` and `FungibleTokenMetadata`. (These initial parameters will be synced to this contract by calling function `sync_basedata_of_wrapped_appchain_token` at construction time of wrapped appchain token contract. Refer to [Octopus Wrapped Appchain Token](https://github.com/octopus-network/wrapped-appchain-token).)
